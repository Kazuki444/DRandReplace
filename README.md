# DRandReplace
In this study, we developed a system that combines Generic object recognition and image processing with AR technology 
to visually remove real objects and display only virtual objects in the same category as the real objects. 
In this system, categories and regions to be removed get from generic object recognition.
An image which the object erased from by image processing use as a background of AR, and we set a virtual object 
which is the same category as the recognized category. This system operates on one smartphone
